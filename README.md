# Redux

This is a simple React application developed with Redux to manage global state efficiently. The app simulates various banking operations, including withdrawing and depositing funds, requesting loans, and making loan repayments. The project was primarily created to enhance my skills in React and Redux by implementing real-world scenarios of state management across the application.
